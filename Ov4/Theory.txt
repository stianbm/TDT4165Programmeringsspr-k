a)
	The difference between a list and a stream is that a list has a defined end element of nil, while a
	stream is recursively defined and infinite.
	
b)
	During lazy execution, if there is an exception then the computer will start solving other parts of the
	code to see if the problem is solved somwhere else. This can complicate the use of the exceptions, as
	one is not certain when they are encountered and/or solved. (bindes til variable in question)
	
c)
	Write the if sentence to stop execution after a number of recursions. In other words a list is made of the
	X first elements in the output stream and append the rest of the stream as the last element of the list.
	If it is not included the machine just tells you it has an infinite stream as output, without showing any
	elements.
