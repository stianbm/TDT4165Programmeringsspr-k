Theory exercise 2 task 4
	a)
		A = {+, -, *, /}
		N = {n} for n element i N (Heltall)
		K = {p, d, ^, i}
		D = {N, K, A}}
		<C> = {<D>, <D><D>, NN<A>}
		
	b)
		Goes from <F>=<F>NAN<F> to <F>NNA<F> . Because parentheses are negated, the grammar will be un*ambigous, as (5-2)*3
		becomes 5-2*3.
		
	c)
		In a context free language all rules are on the form V ::== G, which means that the rules holds for
		all cases. A context sensitive language will, however, have rules on the form wVx ::== wGx. Meaning
		that the rules are dependant on the context, w and x.
		
	d)
		The float-int error happens because ints and floats are non-compatible without conversion. This
		can be useful because it will let you keep track of your datatypes, which is essential if you're
		making a memory- or prosessing sensitive program.
